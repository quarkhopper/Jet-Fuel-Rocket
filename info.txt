description = [h1]Pyrotechnics for your steel beam needs.[/h1] Use the options for fine control of the simulation, character, and aesthetics of plumes of fire and explosions. You can click to make things explosives, send jets of fire skyward, or even watch something fry from the inside out. MAKE YOUR OWN OBJECTS SHOOT FLAMES AND EXPLODE! Stick explosives and flame throwing nozzles on anything, or throw bombs around like grenades. The fire billows and flows around objects (mostly) naturally. [h2]For information on how the mod works and all of the options available, see the documentation at: https://github.com/quarkhopper/Jet-Fuel/blob/main/README.md[/h2]
